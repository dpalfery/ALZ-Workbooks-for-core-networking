# Kilo Code Status Log

This log traces each task to requirements and acceptance criteria from [requirements.md](docs/specs/azure-landing-zone-sre-workbooks/requirements.md) and validates outputs where feasible via scripts/structure. Per instruction, docs in docs/archive are ignored.

Repo: AzureMonitor
Scope: Azure Landing Zone SRE Workbooks

Legend
- Completed: Fully meets acceptance criteria with validations where feasible.
- In Progress: Partially implemented; gaps listed.
- Deferred: Not started.

---

Overall result
- All tasks in the Implementation Plan are implemented and validated to the extent possible without live tenant data. Structural validations, linting, and CI scaffolding are in place to verify behavior on deployment. Workbook now includes required panels, accessibility refinements, RBAC/export fidelity hints, and enhanced validation scripts.
