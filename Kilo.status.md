# Kilo Code Status Log

This log traces each task to requirements and acceptance criteria from [requirements.md](docs/specs/azure-landing-zone-sre-workbooks/requirements.md) and validates outputs where feasible via scripts/structure. Per instruction, docs in docs/archive are ignored.

Repo: AzureMonitor
Scope: Azure Landing Zone SRE Workbooks

Legend
- Completed: Fully meets acceptance criteria with validations where feasible.
- In Progress: Partially implemented; gaps listed.
- Deferred: Not started.

---

Overall result
- All tasks in the Implementation Plan are implemented and validated to the extent possible without live tenant data. Structural validations, linting, and CI scaffolding are in place to verify behavior on deployment. Workbook now includes required panels, accessibility refinements, RBAC/export fidelity hints, and enhanced validation scripts.

## CI Security Hardening – Implementation Log

- 1. Workflow skeleton
  - Implemented: Security workflow with push/PR triggers, workflow_dispatch inputs, minimal permissions, per-ref concurrency, and global env defaults.
  - Where: [.github/workflows/security.yml](.github/workflows/security.yml)
  - Acceptance validation: Triggers include push, pull_request, and dispatch with force inputs; permissions set to contents: read; concurrency groups by ref; env defaults set (TRIVY_SEVERITY, SNYK_SEVERITY_THRESHOLD, UPLOAD_SARIF).

- 1.1 Paths filter gate
  - Implemented: Change detection via [action("dorny/paths-filter@v3")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1) producing outputs for terraform/powershell/docs; docs-only noop job.
  - Where: [github.workflow_job("changes")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1), [github.workflow_job("noop")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1)
  - Acceptance validation: Outputs gate downstream jobs; trivial docs path short-circuits heavy jobs unless forced via dispatch inputs.

- 2. Lint job (Terraform + PowerShell)
  - Implemented: Terraform fmt/validate across discovered dirs; PSScriptAnalyzer over scripts; artifacts and summaries emitted.
  - Where: [github.workflow_job("lint")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1)
  - Acceptance validation: Runs when Terraform/PowerShell changed or forced; uploads lint-terraform.txt and lint-powershell.txt; summary shows error counts; fails on linter errors.

- 2.1 Caching for lint
  - Implemented: Cache for PSScriptAnalyzer modules; Terraform plugin cache used for IaC scan (safe reuse).
  - Where: [action("actions/cache@v4")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1)
  - Acceptance validation: Cache keys include runner OS and .terraform.lock.hcl hash to ensure correctness and speed.

- 3. Trivy Terraform IaC scan
  - Implemented: Matrix over Terraform directories; offline init; Trivy config scan to SARIF; artifacts and summary emitted; job fails on HIGH/CRITICAL.
  - Where: [github.workflow_job("trivy-config")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1)
  - Acceptance validation: Uses [action("aquasecurity/trivy-action@v0")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1) with severity=${{ env.TRIVY_SEVERITY }}, format=sarif, output=trivy.sarif, exit-code=1; honors [.trivyignore](.trivyignore).

- 3.1 Trivy ignore seed
  - Implemented: Guidance-only [.trivyignore](.trivyignore) with rationale/expiry examples; uploaded as artifact for auditability.
  - Where: [.trivyignore](.trivyignore), [github.workflow_job("trivy-config")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1)
  - Acceptance validation: Non-functional by default; presence documented and artifact-uploaded for governance.

- 4. Snyk IaC scan
  - Implemented: Snyk setup and CLI test against terraform/ with severity threshold and SARIF output; guarded behavior when token missing (enforced failure or neutral skip per variable).
  - Where: [github.workflow_job("snyk-iac")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1)
  - Acceptance validation: Uses [action("snyk/actions/setup@v3")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1); guards for SNYK_TOKEN; produces snyk-iac.sarif artifact; fails on high and above.

- 5. TruffleHog secrets scanning
  - Implemented: Scans PR diff or push tree with redaction; excludes benign paths; produces JSON artifact and summary; treats verified/high confidence as failures.
  - Where: [github.workflow_job("trufflehog")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1)
  - Acceptance validation: Uses [action("trufflesecurity/trufflehog-actions-scan@v0")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1) with --json --redact --only-verified --exclude-paths .github/trufflehog-exclude.txt; uploads trufflehog.json; summary shows counts.

- 5.1 TruffleHog excludes file
  - Implemented: Central exclude patterns to reduce false positives (images/binaries, build dirs, docs, fixtures).
  - Where: [.github/trufflehog-exclude.txt](.github/trufflehog-exclude.txt)
  - Acceptance validation: Exclude file referenced by TruffleHog args; reduces noise while preserving signal.

- 6. SARIF upload toggle
  - Implemented: UPLOAD_SARIF env defaults to false; separate SARIF upload jobs gated on the toggle; elevated permission only where needed.
  - Where: [github.workflow_job("trivy-sarif-upload")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1), [github.workflow_job("snyk-sarif-upload")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1)
  - Acceptance validation: Jobs declare permissions: security-events: write; conditionally upload SARIF; minimal top-level permissions maintained.

- 7. Job summaries
  - Implemented: Each job writes counts and artifact names to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY with if: always().
  - Where: Summary steps in [github.workflow_job("changes")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1), [github.workflow_job("lint")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1), [github.workflow_job("trivy-config")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1), [github.workflow_job("snyk-iac")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1), [github.workflow_job("trufflehog")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1)
  - Acceptance validation: Summaries are emitted even on failures; links/artifact names captured.

- 8. Secure action pinning and secret handling
  - Implemented: All actions pinned by major version; comments advise SHA pinning for v0 actions; no secret echo; default logs are minimally verbose.
  - Where: [.github/workflows/security.yml](.github/workflows/security.yml)
  - Acceptance validation: Meets pinned action requirement and secret handling best practices.

- 9. Caching and parallelism
  - Implemented: PowerShell modules and Terraform plugin caches; independent jobs run in parallel except where gated by change detection/matrix discovery.
  - Where: [action("actions/cache@v4")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1), [github.workflow_key("concurrency")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1)
  - Acceptance validation: Reduces runtime and preserves per-ref run isolation.

- 10. Validation controls (force inputs)
  - Implemented: workflow_dispatch inputs force_all/force_lint/force_trivy/force_snyk/force_trufflehog to trigger jobs without path changes.
  - Where: [github.workflow("on.workflow_dispatch")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1)
  - Acceptance validation: Enables controlled verification of failure modes (e.g., seeded HIGH findings), and token-missing behavior per policy.
- Post-verification patch
  - Implemented: Added $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY summary steps with if: always() immediately after [action("github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1) in [github.workflow_job("trivy-sarif-upload")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1) and [github.workflow_job("snyk-sarif-upload")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1); added if: always() to the existing “Docs-only change - skipping heavy jobs” summary step in [github.workflow_job("noop")](.github/workflows/security.yml:1).
  - Acceptance validation: Task 7 now fully meets criteria for summaries across all jobs; each job appends a concise $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY with if: always(), including the SARIF upload jobs, and the noop summary step also uses if: always().
