# Trivy Ignore File
# Purpose: document justified suppressions for IaC (Terraform) config findings.
# Guidance:
# - Each suppression MUST include a rationale and an expiry date in ISO format.
# - Prefer short-lived waivers; review periodically.
# - Example format:
#   # Ignore ID: AVD-TF-0001 | Rationale: using approved exception pattern | Expires: 2025-12-31
#   AVD-TF-0001
#
# Repository-specific notes:
# - Keep this file small; avoid blanket ignores.
# - Do not commit secrets. Use TruffleHog and reviews to prevent this.
#
# Example entries (commented out):
# # Ignore ID: AVD-TF-0002 | Rationale: managed by platform team | Expires: 2025-06-30
